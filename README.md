## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Phoebe, a sophomore Info Science Student @ Cornell.

I've always been interested in tech but haven't quite pinpointed what area. Here's my road to mastering **full-stack development**, practicing **data science** skills, and building some cool projects to make the every day a little bit easier :)

Feel free to send me an email or connect on [Linkedin](http://linkedin.com/in/phoebe-wang28/)!
